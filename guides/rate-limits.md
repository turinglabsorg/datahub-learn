# 🚨 Quotas & Rate Limits

## Difference Between Quotas and Rate Limits

A Quota measures how many total requests you can make across _all your services_ in one day.

A Rate Limit measures how many requests you can make against a _specific endpoint_ in one minute.

If you go over your Quota for the day, you'll need to upgrade your plan.

If you hit a Rate Limit for an endpoint, you'll need to retry your requests.

The goal of a Quota is to allow customers to pay for what they use, similar to a cell phone plan.

The goal of a Rate Limit is to ensure quality of service, and most users will never come close to hitting a Rate Limit.

## How Do I Know When I've Hit My Quota?

DataHub will return status code `HTTP 429` "Too Many Requests" when you exceed your Quota.

To confirm this, you can view your current Quota usage on your DataHub Dashboard.

You can upgrade your plan to increase your Quota.

## How Do I Know When I'm Getting Rate Limited?

DataHub will return status code `HTTP 429` "Too Many Requests" when you are getting rate limited for a specific endpoint.

If this happens, you can confirm on your DataHub Dashboard that you are not over your Quota and that you are instead getting rate limited.

If you are getting rate limited, you will need to retry your requests in your application. Since Rate Limits are measured per minute, you could simply wait 60 seconds and try again.
