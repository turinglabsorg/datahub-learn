# Create, Mint and Transfer NFT with Avalanche Wallet

## Prerequisites

 In preparation for the tutorial, we will need to have some images on hand for testing the upload to Avalanche wallet. For more information on the Avalanche wallet, please refer to the documentation here "(https://docs.avax.network/)"

## References

This tutorial is based on the original one on the [Avalanche Documentation](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/smart-digital-assets/wallet-nft-studio).


## Introduction

NFT is an interesting term nowadays, I first interacted with this creature when I was playing around on Avalanche wallet. These are `Collectibles` that you can create and share with each other. In more technical terms NFT collectible is called ERC721 token. Please refer below link to learn more about ERC-720/721 tokens
(https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/).
Ethereum Request-It provides functionalities like to transfer tokens from one account to another, to get the current token balance of an account, to get the owner of a specific token and also the total supply of the token available on the network.
It is basically a form of “art” that can be a picture, tweet, audio etc in broader perspective. A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data on a digital ledger called blockchain, where each NFT represents something unique item, that can’t be interchanged.
This enables many use cases that would be impossible with interchangeable tokens, like utility, proof of ownership and transaction history of a unique asset.

## 1. Create NFTs

### Create New Wallet

Step 1- Go to [Avalanche wallet](wallet.avax.network) and click on create new wallet.

### Generate Key Phrase

 Step 2- Now, you will be directed to a new window "Generate key Phrase", where you will see a list of keycodes and need to save or capture the given set of 12-24 words somewhere safe.
This list of code will help to access your account( do not share it with anyone)

you will be directed to your key phrase window,

### Verify And Access Wallet

 Step 3- After Generating and capturing the list of codes, you will again need to verify the key-phrase( list of codes), where you have to fill in the blanks in order to access your account.

Now, you can access your account. Click access and you will be directed to the account window.

In your avalanche wallet window, you will see-
Balance, Assets, Wallet Address, Transaction & Transaction History (as shown in image)

![](https://github.com/Devilla/datahub-learn/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/avalanche-wallet.png)

On the left sidebar, you will have other options too, like
Send, Earn, Cross-chain, Studio, Activity, Manage keys, Advanced(as showm in image)

### NFT Studio on Avalanche Wallet

To make experimenting with the creation and exchange of NFTs easier, the in-built **NFT Studio** in the [Avalanche Wallet](https://wallet.avax.network/), where you can use it to create NFTs as assets that we call Collectibles. Collectibles can be generic NFTs with a picture and a description, or custom NFTs with payloads containing JSON, custom URL, or UTF-8 data. You can create them using a simple point and click interface, enabling you to go from the idea of sending NFTs to your friends within minutes. No technical knowledge is required.

Step 4- To access the **NFT Studio**, log into your Avalanche Wallet, and on the left side select **Studio**:

Step 5- This will open the NFT Studio. There you have two options: **New Family**, for the creation of a new family of NFTs, and **Mint Collectible** for creating new assets in existing families. We need to create our first family of NFTs, so click **New Family**.

### Create a NFT Family

There you will be asked to enter the name of your collectible family, as well as a symbol \(ticker\). Names do not have to be unique.

## 2. Mint NFTs

Before minting, Go to the Studio tab as shown below- you will see a heading " Collectibles", in which two sections are provided
* New family
* Mint collectibles

Step 6- Concerning the above image, go and click on Studio, where you have to create new family if you are a new user.

![](https://github.com/Devilla/datahub-learn/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/create-new-family-studio.png)

Step 7- When you decided upon the name, ticker, and a number of groups, press **Create** to create the collectible family. The transaction fee will be deducted from your wallet's balance. When the family is created, you will see the transaction ID \(TxID\), as well as parameters for the family.

Step 8- You can use the TxID to look up the transaction in [the explorer](https://explorer.avax.network/)
Besides the name and the ticker, you will need to enter **Number of Groups**, that is, how many distinct collectibles will the newly created family hold. Choose carefully, because once created, the parameters of the collectible family cannot be changed.

Step 9- After pressing **Mint Collectible** you will be presented with a list of all the Collectible families that still have Collectible groups that have not been created yet
as shown in the above image.

Step 10- you need to create a new mint, by providing a name, a code, and a number of groups.
Note- (a fee of 0.1 Avax will be deducted from your balance), to give it a test, follow below steps:
to get Avax coin, you need to change the network setting from mainnet to Fuji-test network.

Step 11- Go to Avax faucet:
![](https://faucet.avax-test.network/)

![](https://github.com/Devilla/datahub-learn/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/avax-faucet-testnet.PNG)

Step 12- copy the address from your avalanche wallet and paste it in the address bar, you will receive 2 Avax coins.

Step 13- Select the family we have just created. You will be presented with a form to fill out with the parameters of the new collectible:

![](https://github.com/Devilla/datahub-learn/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/mint-collectibles.png)

Step 14- Press **Back to Studio** to return, and we're ready to create our first collectibles. Press **Mint Collectible**.
but if minting is not supported, then you need to create a new collectible family as shown below.

![](https://github.com/Devilla/datahub-learn/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/wallet-avax-network.png)

By default, a **Generic** type of collectible will be selected.

Step 15- That is an NFT that has a **Title**, **URL** for the image, and a **Description**. Enter the required data, as well as the **Quantity**, which will determine how many copies of the collectible will be created, and therefore, how many of them you will be able to send. As before, enter the data carefully, you won't be able to change anything once collectibles are minted. You will see a preview of the data where you can check how your collectible will look like.

Step 16- If you would like to have something else besides a picture collectible, select **Custom**.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/nft-studio-05-custom.png)

Step 17- A custom collectible can contain an **UTF-8** encoded string, an **URL**, or a **JSON** payload. The size of the data cannot exceed 1024 characters.

Step 18- After you enter and check the data, press **Mint** to create the collectible. Transaction fees will be deducted from your wallet, and a newly created collectible will be placed in your wallet.

### See your collectibles

Step 1- An overview of your collectibles is always visible at the top of the screen, along with your balances.

![](https://github.com/Devilla/datahub-learn/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/avalanche-balance.png)

Step 2- To see your collectibles in more detail, select **Portfolio** from the left-hand side menu. You will be presented with a screen showing all of your assets, with tokens selected by default. Change the selection to **Collectibles** by clicking the corresponding tab.

![](https://github.com/Devilla/datahub-learn/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/collectible-coin.png)

Step 3- For each Generic collectible, a picture will be shown, along with the title, and the number indicating how many copies of the collectible are in your portfolio. Hovering over the collectible with your pointer will show the detailed description:

Step 4- If you select a collectible by clicking on it, you will see which group it belongs to, its quantity, along with the **Send** button.

## 3. Transfer NFTs

Step 1- To send your collectible to someone, either click the **Send** button on the selected collectible in the Portfolio, or navigate to the **Send** tab on the left-hand side menu, and click **Add Collectible**:

Step 2- You will be presented with a menu to select a collectible you wish to send.

![](https://github.com/Devilla/datahub-learn/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/pikachu-coin-wallet-address.png)

Step 3- You can send multiple collectibles in a single transaction. Clicking the label on the collectible will let you edit the number of copies you wish to send. You can send multiple families and collectible types in a single transaction.

![](https://github.com/Devilla/datahub-learn/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/send-nft-to-different-wallet.png)

Step 4- When you have entered the destination address, and optionally entered the memo text, press **Confirm** to initiate the transaction.
