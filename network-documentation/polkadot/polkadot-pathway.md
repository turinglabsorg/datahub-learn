# 🗺 Polkadot Pathway

## ![](../../.gitbook/assets/4129.png) Welcome to the Polkadot Pathway

Polkadot enables scalability by allowing specialized blockchains to communicate with each other in a secure, trust-free environment. It is built to connect and secure unique blockchains, whether they be public, permissionless networks, private consortium chains, or oracles, and other Web3 technologies. It enables an internet where independent blockchains can exchange information under common security guarantees.

Learn what makes it unique and build your first project to **earn 1.1 DOTs**!

Disclaimer: Unfortunately, due to the recent actions of a small group of scammers, we are unable to reward DOT to developers based in Russia or Ukraine for completing the pathway. You are still more than welcome to participate in our learn community and are able to become a tutorial contributor. We will consider submissions by our active community members on a case-by-case basis.
