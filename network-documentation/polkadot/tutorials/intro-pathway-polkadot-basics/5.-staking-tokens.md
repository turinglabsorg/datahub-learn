# 5. Staking tokens

We will be building on top of the Node.js application created in the previous tutorials, so make sure to have completed :

In this tutorial, we're going to go one step further and see how we can use our tokens to participate in the Westend blockchain consensus protocol. We are going to lend our tokens to a node which will increase that nodes chances of being selected to validate a block and in return collect rewards that we will get a share of.

Polkadot uses NPoS \(Nominated Proof-of-Stake\) as its mechanism for selecting the validator set.  
This is known as _hybrid consensus_. Hybrid consensus splits up the block production mechanism -  
[BABE](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-consensus#babe) \(Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension\), and the finality gadget - [GRANDPA](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-consensus#grandpa-finality-gadget) \(GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement\). These terms may sound silly, however they form a crucial part of how Polkadot operates and are both worth taking the time to understand. The functionality of staking has been abstracted to a high enough level that we can perform all necessary operations with only a few lines of code. To better understand the mechanics of staking, we will dive right into them!

## Create a proxy account

First we need to create a separate account, called a [Proxy Account](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-proxies), that we will use to make staking transactions.

The "Staking" type of proxy allows staking-related transactions, however we must not confuse a Staking Proxy with the Controller account. Within the Staking pallet, some transactions must come from the Stash, while others must come from the Controller. The Stash account is meant to stay in cold storage, while the Controller account makes day-to-day transactions like setting session keys or deciding which validators to nominate.

The Stash account is still required to make some transactions; bonding extra funds or designating a new Controller. A proxy doesn't change the _roles_ of Stash and Controller accounts, but does allow the Stash to be accessed even less frequently.

Run `create_account.js` just the way we did it in the second step of the pathway. This newly created account will be our proxy account. See the new mnemonic and address in the terminal, then copy and paste that new information into our `.env` file with the following variable names :

```javascript
PROXY_MNEMONIC=<paste_mnemonic_here>
PROXY_ADDRESS=<paste_address_here>
```

## Add proxies to this Proxy account

Create a new file called `staking_proxy.js` and paste the following code into it :

```javascript
const { ApiPromise, Keyring } = require('@polkadot/api');
const { HttpProvider } = require('@polkadot/rpc-provider');
require("dotenv").config();

const main = async () => {
  const httpProvider = new HttpProvider(process.env.DATAHUB_URL);
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: httpProvider });
  const keyring = new Keyring({type: 'sr25519'});

  // Initialize accounts from the mnemonic
  const account = keyring.addFromUri(process.env.MNEMONIC);
  const proxyAccount = keyring.addFromUri(process.env.PROXY_MNEMONIC);

  // Get number of proxies for the given address
  const [proxies] = await api.query.proxy.proxies(account.address);
  console.log(`# of proxies for address ${account.address}`, proxies.length);
  console.log(`proxyDepositBase: ${api.consts.proxy.proxyDepositBase}`);
  console.log(`proxyDepositFactor: ${api.consts.proxy.proxyDepositFactor}`);

  // calculate the amount that needs to be deposited in each proxy
  const requiredDeposit = api.consts.proxy.proxyDepositBase + api.consts.proxy.proxyDepositFactor * proxies.length;
  console.log(`Required deposit for creating proxy: ${requiredDeposit}`);

  // Add a staking proxy
  const proxyType = 'Staking';
  const delay = 0;
  let txHash = await api.tx.proxy
    .addProxy(proxyAccount.address, proxyType, delay)
    .signAndSend(account);
  console.log(`.addProxy() tx: https://westend.subscan.io/extrinsic/${txHash}`);
};

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
}).finally(() => process.exit());
```

Ignore the familiar boilerplate code for the moment and focus on the API queries and the `.addProxy()` extrinsic, to understand what is happening when this program is run :

```javascript
// Get number of proxies for the given address
const [proxies] = await api.query.proxy.proxies(account.address);
console.log(`# of proxies for address ${account.address}`, proxies.length);
console.log(`proxyDepositBase: ${api.consts.proxy.proxyDepositBase}`);
console.log(`proxyDepositFactor: ${api.consts.proxy.proxyDepositFactor}`);
```

The `[proxies]` array is being populated with the `api.query.proxy.proxies()` call. We are passing in our account address and asking the Polkadot API to report to us any proxies related to our account.  
`proxies.length` is referring to the length of the array, so if we were to add several more proxy accounts in the future, we would expect this number to increase.

`api.consts.proxy` is the API interface to look at the constants defined in the Polkadot spec for proxy accounts. Specifically we are going to look at the `proxyDepositBase` and the `proxyDepositFactor` . Why will become clear in a moment.

```javascript
// calculate the amount that needs to be deposited in each proxy
const requiredDeposit = api.consts.proxy.proxyDepositBase + api.consts.proxy.proxyDepositFactor * proxies.length;
console.log(`Required deposit for creating proxy: ${requiredDeposit}`);
```

There is the matter of a required deposit for any of our proxy accounts, thus we will calculate the `requiredDeposit` by adding the `proxyDepositBase` to the `proxtDepositFactor` and multiplying that by the length of the proxies array. Remember that the length of this array is going to be equal to the number of proxy accounts we have defined.

```javascript
// Add a staking proxy
const proxyType = 'Staking';
const delay = 0;
let txHash = await api.tx.proxy
  .addProxy(proxyAccount.address, proxyType, delay)
  .signAndSend(account);
console.log(`.addProxy() tx: https://westend.subscan.io/extrinsic/${txHash}`);
```

The extrinsic `.addProxy()` is going to take in our `proxyAccount.address` , the `Staking` proxyType, with a delay of `0` . Finally, we will need to method chain the `.signAndSend()` call, passing in our `account`. This accomplishes precisely what it says : signing the `.addProxy()` extrinsic, then sending the transaction to the network. For convenience, we will generate a link to view the transaction on the SubScan block explorer.

Run the code with :

```bash
$ node staking_proxy.js
```

The output should look like :

```bash
proxyDepositBase: 1000400000000
proxyDepositFactor: 1650000000
# of proxies for address 5Hpg2CiA3uDEHmRBfyop2MWP7n5otMLK7BwTKmgwcLBge6H2 0
Required deposit for creating proxy: 10004000000000
View .addProxy() tx: https://westend.subscan.io/extrinsic/0x8f2fbfab3c0f2fd2b75ea434ab4dceef4235a62b3e2f2d59c881db9ed5b9ddf1
```

If you visit the explorer URL you will see :

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2822%29.png)

The call was an "Add\_proxy" and was a success. The "Sender" is the first account we created and the proxy's address appears under "delegate". Nice! Let's keep going.

## Fund the proxy account

Now create a new file called `fund.js` and paste the following code into it :

```javascript
const { ApiPromise, Keyring } = require('@polkadot/api');
const { HttpProvider } = require('@polkadot/rpc-provider');
require("dotenv").config();

const main = async () => {
  const httpProvider = new HttpProvider(process.env.DATAHUB_URL);
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: httpProvider });
  const keyring = new Keyring({type: 'sr25519'});

  // Initialize account from the mnemonic
  const account = keyring.addFromUri(process.env.MNEMONIC);

  // Send tokens to proxy account
  const recipientAddr = process.env.PROXY_ADDRESS;
  const txHash = await api.tx.balances
    .transfer(recipientAddr, 100000000000)
    .signAndSend(account);

  console.log(`Funded proxy account: https://westend.subscan.io/extrinsic/${txHash}`);
};

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
}).finally(() => process.exit());
```

The boilerplate should be quite familiar at this point, so let us focus on the extrinsics. We will use `.transfer()` to send `100000000000` , which equates to `0.1` WND, to the proxy account having defined that address in our `.env` in the initial step to create a proxy. This will transfer some funds from our account to the proxy account and output a convenient link to view the transaction details on SubScan.

Run the code with :

```bash
$ node fund.js
```

The console output should look like :

```bash
Funded proxy account: https://westend.subscan.io/extrinsic/0x8d21a42ace8f0bff88b963741811ace7e7bfa146a50c192fd1ce82eeaf3deda8
```

Following the link to the SubScan explorer webpage should confirm that the funding transfer worked.

![](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-MIVL6JKxnpiaciltfue%2F-MYpq4nHK15-bzPnXh1X%2F-MYpqIPDE5uROt-suAjp%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=4fac5566-79ab-4528-a3e3-298a2d6f2223)

Let's move on!

## Bonding tokens

Create a `bond.js`. Paste the following code into this file and remember to save it to disk :

```javascript
const { ApiPromise, Keyring } = require('@polkadot/api');
const { HttpProvider } = require('@polkadot/rpc-provider');
require("dotenv").config();

const main = async () => {
  const httpProvider = new HttpProvider(process.env.DATAHUB_URL);
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: httpProvider });
  const keyring = new Keyring({type: 'sr25519'});

  // Initialize account from the mnemonic
  const proxyAccount = keyring.addFromUri(process.env.PROXY_MNEMONIC);

  // First we have to bond funds.
  // Here we use 'Stash' as reward destination
  // which means that received rewards will increase staked amount
  const amount = 1000000000000;
  const rewardDestination = 'Stash';
  let txHash = await api.tx.staking
    .bond(proxyAccount.address, amount, rewardDestination)
    .signAndSend(proxyAccount);

  console.log(`View .bond() tx: https://westend.subscan.io/extrinsic/${txHash}`);
};

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
}).finally(() => process.exit());
```

For this task, we will need to utilize the `.bond()` extrinsic, passing in our `proxyAccount.address` , the desired `amount` to bond, and specifying the `rewardDestination` as `Stash` .

Run the code with :

```bash
$ node bond.js
```

Visit the explorer URL in the console output and it should confirm that the bonding transaction worked.

## Nominate validators

Create a new file called `nominate.js`, pasting the following code into it :

```javascript
const { ApiPromise, Keyring } = require('@polkadot/api');
const { HttpProvider } = require('@polkadot/rpc-provider');
require("dotenv").config();

const main = async () => {
  const httpProvider = new HttpProvider(process.env.DATAHUB_URL);
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: httpProvider });
  const keyring = new Keyring({type: 'sr25519'});

  // Initialize account from the mnemonic
  const proxyAccount = keyring.addFromUri(process.env.PROXY_MNEMONIC);

  // Nominate validators
  // The list of validators can be found here
  // https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fwestend-rpc.polkadot.io#/staking
  // We picked one but feel free to pick different ones
  const validator1 = '5CFPcUJgYgWryPaV1aYjSbTpbTLu42V32Ytw1L9rfoMAsfGh';
  const validator2 = '5CPDNHdbZMNNeHLq7t9Cc434CM1fBL6tkaifiCG3kaQ8KHv8';

  txHash = await api.tx.staking
    .nominate([validator1, validator2])
    .signAndSend(proxyAccount);

console.log(`View .nominate() tx: https://westend.subscan.io/extrinsic/${txHash}`);
};

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
}).finally(() => process.exit());
```

Once again, ignoring the boilerplate to focus on the method chaining using our `proxyAccount` to `.signAndSend()` the `.nominate()` extrinsic, to which we have supplied an array of our chosen validators, referenced by their address. Is that ever a mouthful! Here, let us go through it again :

```javascript
txHash = await api.tx.staking
    .nominate([validator1, validator2])
    .signAndSend(proxyAccount);
```

We are defining a variable named `txHash` and assigning it the value of the asynchronous Promise being returned by the line : `await api.tx.staking.nominate([validator1, validator2]).signAndSend(proxyAccount);` .

Run the code with :

```bash
$ node nominate.js
```

Visit the explorer URL in the console output and it should confirm that the validators have been nominated.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, we learned how to set up a Proxy Account, fund the proxy account, bond tokens using the Proxy Account, and also how to nominate validators. We covered the relevant Extrinsics, which are API functions that we use to interact with Polkadot. We have come a long way from the first tutorial in the pathway! Be sure to take breaks, and to read further documentation when you have the opportunity. Polkadot is designed with some nice features to make development easier, though they still require quite a bit of time and study to fully understand. A solid grasp of extrinsics will serve us well when working with Polkadot.

As a suggested activity for deeper understanding : Consider refactoring some of the code presented here into a single, functional application that can be used as a command line tool to automate the process of creating and funding proxy accounts.

In the next tutorial, we will cover using a library called `axios` to request historical transaction data from DataHub. Take a moment to reflect on the previous steps. What have we learned from them? How are the principles from each step being used to further our understanding?
