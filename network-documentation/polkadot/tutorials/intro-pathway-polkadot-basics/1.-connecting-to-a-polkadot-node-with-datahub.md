# 1. Connecting to a Polkadot node with DataHub

In this tutorial, we are going to connect to a Polkadot node hosted by [**DataHub**](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up?service=near) using an RPC Provider. We are going to build a few simple Node.js applications, which will serve as practical tools to develop further understanding of using Polkadot and other Substrate based blockchains. In each tutorial, we will cover a different aspect of interacting with Polkadot, from simply connecting to a node; to staking tokens; all the way through to searching historical block data for specific transactions with DataHub.

Polkadot has built a [JavaScript library](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) to help developers easily interface with its API. The documentation for Polkadot JS can be found at [https://polkadot.js.org/docs/](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/)

## Node.js

{% hint style="info" %}
The Polkadot Pathway requires **at least version 12.19.1 of Node.js.** Anything above 12.19.1 will work
{% endhint %}

We encourage developers to use a version manager to easily switch between different Node.js engine versions without having to worry about breaking any of their existing projects or development setups. We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Once you've installed node, verify the version is 12.19.1 or greater,

```bash
# NOTE:
# Outside of template literals, where the syntax is ${<expression>} - 
# The $ character denotes a Linux command prompt, not part of a command.
# On Windows the command prompt is indicated by an angle bracket >
#
# ONLY type in "node -v"

$ node -v
v12.19.1
```

## Project setup

{% hint style="info" %}
It is a good idea to keep a separate directory for all of our project directories or cloned code repos. This directory might be named `projects`or`repos`or anything that will assist us in staying organized. The point is to know which directory we are working in for the duration of this Pathway.

* Linux users can make this directory inside of their `home` directory, located at `/home/username` on many distributions - for example `/home/alice/projects`
* Windows users should consider making a new Folder within their user directory, located at `C:\Users\<username>\` - for example `C:\Users\alice\projects`
{% endhint %}

The first step is to create a directory for our project where we will initialize it as a Node.js project with a `package.json`. In the terminal, issue the following commands :

```javascript
$ mkdir polkadot
$ cd polkadot
$ npm init -y
```

As a result we now have a new file `package.json` in the current directory \(`~/projects/polkadot`\) which enables us to use Node.js to execute the code in our source files. We're going to just leave the file as is for now, but it is good to understand what is going on here :

```javascript
{
  "name": "polkadot",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {}
}
```

Each key-value pair in this JSON file tells Node.js something about our project. Minus the `scripts` and `dependencies` sections, this is the minimum amount of information that Node.js requires in order to run an application from a `package.json`.

## Installing packages

Now that we have our Node.js application set up, we can install the required dependencies:

* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), for storing Environment Variables and other sensitive information.
* [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), for sending JSON-RPC via HTTP/S. This will be covered in the Transaction search tutorial.
* [@polkadot/api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polkadot/api), for interfacing with the Polkadot API. 

Install these packages with a single command :

```bash
$ npm install --save dotenv axios @polkadot/api
```

After the installation is successful, you will also be able to see the packages added to the dependencies in the `package.json` file like so :

```javascript
{
  "name": "polkadot",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "@polkadot/api": "^4.6.2",
    "axios": "^0.21.1",
    "dotenv": "^8.2.0"
  }
}
```

## Storing the Datahub API key

Next, create an `.env` file at the root of the directory. It will hold all our sensitive data as we build our application.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The `.env` file should be kept safe, as it is designed to hold sensitive information such the DataHub API access key and mnemonic seed phrases. We should _never checkout_ this file to a git repository! To prevent this from happening, we must make sure to create a `.gitignore` file in the root of our project directory, then add the filename `.env` to it, making sure to then save the `.gitignore`file to disk. As the name implies, this will instruct git to leave our `.env` file alone.

The consequences of failing to properly secure sensitive data tend to be severe, so as developers we must take all available precautions to safeguard such data.
{% endhint %}

Open this `.env` file in your text editor or IDE and add in the following line :

```javascript
DATAHUB_URL=https://polkadot-westend--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/<API_KEY>
```

Replace `<API_KEY>` with a valid DataHub API key. To obtain a valid API key we just need to visit the [DataHub dashboard](https://datahub.figment.io/). Sign up for an account first if we do not already have one, then once logged in click on "Polkadot" in the list of available services.

We will be able to copy the unique API key from the dashboard. It is blurred out by default to protect our privacy, simply clicking the 'copy' button to the right of the blurred key will enable us to then paste it into the `.env` file, replacing the entire bracketed text `<API_KEY>`.

## Interacting with the Polkadot node

Now that we have completed all the necessary configuration steps, we can start building our application. Start by requiring or importing the packages we have installed, then demonstrate everything is working properly by connecting to the API and requesting a timestamp. There are a few different concepts at work in the code, so let's break it down for better understanding.

Create a `connect.js` file at the root of the directory and add the following code :

```javascript
const { ApiPromise } = require('@polkadot/api');
const { HttpProvider } = require('@polkadot/rpc-provider');
require("dotenv").config({path: '.env'});

const main = async () => {
  const httpProvider = new HttpProvider(process.env.DATAHUB_URL);
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: httpProvider });    

  // Query the Polkadot API for a timestamp
  const now = await api.query.timestamp.now();

  console.log(`Last timestamp: ${now}`);
}

main().catch((err) => { console.error(err) }).finally(() => process.exit());
```

Make sure to save the file to disk after pasting the code into your text editor or IDE \([Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)\). We can now examine the code line by line :

```javascript
const { ApiPromise } = require('@polkadot/api');
const { HttpProvider } = require('@polkadot/rpc-provider');
require("dotenv").config();
```

Both the `ApiPromise` and `HttpProvider` work together to allow sending requests using HTTP to an HTTP RPC server. This method does not support subscriptions so we won't be able to listen to events such as new blocks or balance changes. If such functionality is required, using the WebSocket provider will be your first stop. Implementing it is functionally very similar to using the `httpProvider`, except we would need to require `WsProvider` from `@polkadot/api` and instantiate it as `new WsProvider()`. For the purposes of this Pathway, we will be using the `httpProvider` in every step.

Next, we load the Polkadot node client configuration from environment variables created during our initial setup. Calling the `.config()` method of dotenv on the `require()` function this way, with no parameters, will load from `.env` by default. We use this dependency for convenience and [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns), instead of hardcoding values directly into our application which is an [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern) and should be avoided when possible. It also allows us to define the variables once in `.env` and use them in every file.

Moving along, we will examine the contents of our `main()` function :

```javascript
const main = async () => {
  const httpProvider = new HttpProvider(process.env.DATAHUB_URL);
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: httpProvider }); 

  // Query the Polkadot API for a timestamp
  const now = await api.query.timestamp.now();

  console.log(`Last timestamp: ${now}`);
}
```

We begin our `main()` function using an anonymous function declaration and 'fat arrow' syntax. This may seem unusual, compared to the more common method of opening a main function, such as `async main() {` . The outcome is the same, in that we can refer to `main()` to execute the function body. Either approach will work here, it is largely up to the choice of the developer. The `async` keyword enables us to get Promises as the result of the `await` keyword.

Pass the `httpProvider` to `ApiPromise.create()` inside of a JSON object. This is all the code which is required to configure a connection to the Polkadot API. It will set up both the `httpProvider` with a connection to the Polkadot RPC endpoint, and instantiate a new ApiPromise which we will reference everywhere in our code with `api` . This keeps everything clean, readable, and simple to understand. In the remainder of the pathway, we will use this same pattern for setting up the `httpProvider`, `api` and defining our main function - so remember it well!

```javascript
// Query the Polkadot API for a timestamp
const now = await api.query.timestamp.now();
```

We construct our API requests by [method chaining](https://x-team.com/blog/javascript-method-chaining/), and all we are going to do right now is query the API for a timestamp.

```javascript
main().catch((err) => { console.error(err) }).finally(() => process.exit());
```

One last thing, we need to actually call our `main()` function so that it executes. We will use `.catch()` & a callback with [arrow function expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) to pass any errors that get generated into `console.error()`. There should not be any, as none of the code within our `main()` function is going to fail - however if the DATAHUB\_URL in `.env` is malformed or the API key is missing, an error most definitely will occur.

Let us now run the program using Node.js to see the result of our timestamp query. Double-check the contents of the local file for errors or omissions, ensure it is saved to disk, and then run the file with the following command :

```javascript
$ node connect.js
```

We will see a similar output in the terminal :

```bash
2021-04-19 16:20:54        API/INIT: Api will be available in a limited mode since the provider does not support subscriptions
Last timestamp: 1618872234000
```

The first line is logging coming directly from the API/INIT module, which is informing us that the API will only be available in a limited mode because the HttpProvider does not support subscriptions. Using the WebSocket provider for subscriptions may be covered in a future advanced pathway.  
The following line is the timestamp which we requested via the API query method in our program. This concludes the first step in understanding how to connect to Polkadot via a DataHub node using the Polkadot JavaScript API.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! In this tutorial, we learned how to use environment variables to keep sensitive information out of our code, and also how to connect to the Polkadot API using an RPC Provider. We successfully connected to a DataHub hosted Polkadot node and performed an API query to the node using a simple method chain.

Stand up and stretch, get a drink of water, take a few deep breaths. Give yourself a pat on the back for learning something new, then get ready for the next step.

In the next tutorial, we will be creating our first Polkadot account on the Westend testnet and funding it with WND by connecting to a chatroom which hosts a faucet, a means for us to request free tokens.
