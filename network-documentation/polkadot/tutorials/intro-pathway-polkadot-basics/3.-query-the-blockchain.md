# 3. Query the blockchain

We will be building on top of the Node.js application created in the previous tutorials, so make sure to have completed : 

1. \*\*\*\*[**Connect to Polkadot using a Datahub node**](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/polkadot/tutorials/intro-pathway-polkadot-basics/1.-connecting-to-a-polkadot-node-with-datahub)\*\*\*\*
2. \*\*\*\*[**Create a Polkadot account**](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/polkadot/tutorials/intro-pathway-polkadot-basics/2.-create-a-polkadot-account)\*\*\*\*

After what we have learned in these previous tutorials, we are now empowered with simple access to the functionality we require. We will implement our RPC Provider connection to the Polkadot API using Promises via the `api` constant, as before.  
Let us begin by creating a new file, `query.js` and including the following code :

```javascript
const { ApiPromise, Keyring } = require('@polkadot/api');
const { HttpProvider } = require('@polkadot/rpc-provider');
require("dotenv").config();

const main = async () => {
  const httpProvider = new HttpProvider(process.env.DATAHUB_URL);
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: httpProvider });
  const keyring = new Keyring({type: 'sr25519'});

  // 1. Query blockchain details
  // 2. Query account details
  // 3. Query validator set
  // 4. Query list of transactions
  // 5. Query blockchain information at given height
  // 6. Query events
}

main().catch((err) => { console.error(err) }).finally(() => process.exit())
```

Because we will be adding in the code to make this program functional as we go, it would be a good plan to follow through each step carefully. Let's explore what this code is doing as we move forward.

## Query blockchain details

Add this snippet inside of our `main()` function, below the line `1. Query blockchain details` :

```javascript
console.log(`Genesis hash: ${api.genesisHash}`);
console.log(`Runtime version: ${api.runtimeVersion}`);
console.log(`Library info: ${api.libraryInfo}`);

const chain = await api.rpc.system.chain();
const lastHeader = await api.rpc.chain.getHeader();

console.log(`Chain name: ${chain}`);
console.log(`Last block number: ${lastHeader.number}`);
console.log(`Last block hash: ${lastHeader.hash}`);
```

The first three lines are going to fetch information from the API, such as the runtime version which lists the name, version numbers and information about which APIs are supported. The genesis hash and library info can be useful. 

Defining constants in this manner, using the `await` keyword to get the data asynchronously, gives us the ability to then refer to the returned information in simple terms. In other function bodies or as template literals, it is much simpler to refer to the results of an RPC query in plain language. There is no strict requirement for constant or variable names, developers are free to express these concepts using whichever words make the most sense to them & the choices we have made here in the example code are by no means definitive. To wit, `const chain` could just as easily be `const figment` and nothing in the code would change except that `${chain}` would no longer be a valid reference within the template literal, instead we would refer to that data with `${figment}` . 

## Query account details

Add the following snippet below the `2. Query account details` comment inside of the `main()` function.

```javascript
const { nonce, refcount, data: balance } = await api.query.system.account(process.env.ADDRESS);
console.log(`Nonce: ${nonce}`);
console.log(`Referendum count: ${refcount}`);
console.log(`Free balance: ${balance.free}`);
console.log(`Reserved balance: ${balance.reserved}`);
```

A nonce is "a number, used once". In the context of blockchains, it is used to indicate how many transactions an account has performed, the nonce being incremented by one for each transaction.

Referring to `data: balance` here, we are [destructuring](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/05/es6-in-depth-destructuring/) the property and applying the name balance to it, so that later in our code we have a more semantically pleasing way of referencing that information. Saying that a balance is some `data.free` makes less sense than saying that a balance is some `balance.free` . 

The Referendum count is related to the [Governance](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance) aspect of Polkadot, where in order to make any changes to the network, the idea is to compose active token holders and the council together to administrate a network upgrade decision. No matter whether the proposal is put forth by the public \(DOT holders\) or the council, it will have to go through a referendum to let all DOT holders, weighted by stake, enact the decision. In many cases for new accounts, this will be firmly at 0.

## Query validators

Add the following snippet below the line `3. Query validator set` :

```javascript
const eraAtRaw = await api.query.staking.activeEra();
const eraAt = eraAtRaw.unwrap().index.toNumber();
const eraStakers = await api.query.staking.erasStakers.entries(eraAt)

eraStakers.map(async ([key, data]) => {
  console.log(`Validator stash account: ${key.args[1]}`);
  console.log(`Total: ${data.total}`);
  console.log(`Own: ${data.own}`);
  console.log('-----------------');
});
```

Here we observe the Stakers of the current era using [`.map()`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-map-how-to-use-the-js-map-function-array-method/) with an asynchronous callback function - `async ([key, data]) => {}` - to iterate over each one of the Stakers and display the Address, Total and Own properties from the `api` query `.erasStakers.entries()`. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Because we do not know beforehand the number of validators to display, the above snippet can possibly flood the terminal to the point that default scrollback settings will leave you unable to see the top of the output. This is a common problem when logging information that you _do not know the length of_ beforehand. One method to easily overcome the excessive output is to determine which `console.log`is responsible, then comment it out - however this is a temporary solution.
{% endhint %}

As a bonus activity, capture all of the console.log output. Consider logging it to a file \(we learned about this in the previous tutorial\), or the code snippet above could be modified so that it doesn't scroll the terminal excessively. Take this opportunity to try different things with the code. Read more documentation. Experiment! Test assumptions using what we have learned.

## Query list of transactions

Add the following snippet below the line `4. Query list of transactions` :

```javascript
// TODO: Replace height and validatorAddr for Westend
const height = 4626906;
const validatorAddr = '16a4Q1iudXznPBx3CzJRaxXtYNenzGAZXdBZZkc5KrNxLXFP';
const blockHash = await api.rpc.chain.getBlockHash(height);

const block = await api.rpc.chain.getBlock(blockHash);
console.log('Block details: ', block.toHuman());

block.block.extrinsics.forEach((extrinsic, index) => {
  if (extrinsic.toHuman().isSigned) {
    console.log(`Signed transaction ${index}: `, extrinsic.toHuman());
  }
});
```

`api.rpc.chain.getBlock()` will query the block hash at a specified block height - We can then format the resulting block hash data for readability using `.toHuman()` . Additionally, `isSigned` returns a boolean, true or false, after checking to see if the underlying API command \(often referred to as an 'extrinsic'\) has an associated signature from a valid keypair. In this way, it is possible to view the encoded data from the blockchain in a Human-readable format.

## Query blockchain metadata

Add the following snippet below the line `5. Query blockchain information at a given height` :

```javascript
const [timestamp, era, session] = await Promise.all([
  api.query.timestamp.now.at(blockHash),
  api.query.staking.currentEra.at(blockHash),
  api.query.session.currentIndex.at(blockHash),
]);
console.log(`Block timestamp: ${timestamp}`);
console.log(`Block era: ${era}`);
console.log(`Block session: ${session}`);
```

Using `Promise.all()` in this manner allows us to asynchronously execute several API queries. The names of the constants should be relevant to the information being requested, but there is no specific requirement or naming convention. It is up to developers to determine what to call their constants or variables, there are only suggestions.

Forming the API query extrinsics is largely a matter of understanding the API calls necessary and placing them into our code where it makes the most sense. The first query, `api.query.timestamp.now.at(blockHash)` is not much different from `api.query.timestamp.now()`, it just refines our request for the timestamp of a specific block hash by including `.at()`.

## Query events

Add the following snippet below the line `6. Query events` :

```javascript
// Get events at given height
const events = await api.query.system.events.at(blockHash);
events.forEach((event, index) => {
  console.log(`Event ${index}: `, event.event.toHuman());
});
```

Here, we need to iterate over the events being returned from the `.system.events.at(blockHash)`  query using `.forEach()` with a callback to log each one. When using `.toHuman()` to format the data for readability, an observant reader may notice that `event.event` is a little bit unusual, which is due to the fact that we are targeting the event property. Effectively, the first `event` is the parameter, the second `event` is the property. Consider the difference in output here :

```javascript
// event.event.toHuman sample output
Event 0:  {
  method: 'ExtrinsicSuccess',
  section: 'system',
  index: '0x0000',
  data: [ { weight: '161,097,000', class: 'Mandatory', paysFee: 'Yes' } ]
}

// event.toHuman() sample output
Event 0:  {
  phase: { ApplyExtrinsic: '0' },
  event: {
    method: 'ExtrinsicSuccess',
    section: 'system',
    index: '0x0000',
    data: [ [Object] ]
  },
  topics: []
}
```

## Run the code

Let us now run our completed query program :

```javascript
$ node query.js
```

You will see a similar output printed to your terminal, although the specifics such as last block number, last block hash and free balance will be different :

```javascript

## Next steps

In this tutorial we have used the `api` we created to query different type of information on the Polkadot blockchain.

In the next tutorial, we will be looking at different queries we can run against a Polkadot node to gather useful information.
