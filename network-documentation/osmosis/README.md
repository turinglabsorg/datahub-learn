# 🧪 Osmosis

## Welcome to the Osmosis documentation!

In this section, you will be able to learn about what makes Osmosis special and how you can leverage available tools to build amazing products!

Check out the Osmosis 101 section to learn more about the protocol and see how it compares to other networks in terms of speed, cost, and functionalities.

You can then get started with the available RPC & REST APIs we support [**via DataHub**](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up?service=osmosis).

Be sure to check out the [**official Osmosis documentation**](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis).
