# 4. Submit your first transactions

## Introduction

At some point, while building on the Secret Network, you will want to submit transactions.

In this tutorial, we will learn two ways to submit transactions using SecretJS and a [DataHub](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up?service=secret) node.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that you have completed the tutorials:

1. [Connecting to a Secret Network node with DataHub](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/secret/tutorials/1.-connecting-to-a-secret-node-using-datahub)
2. [Creating your first Secret Network account](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/secret/tutorials/2.-setting-up-your-wallet.md)
3. [Querying the Secret Network](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/secret/tutorials/3.-querying-the-secret-blockchain)

We will be building on top of the Node.js application created in these tutorials.

In the previous tutorials, we created our account and we used the Testnet faucet to request test tokens. Now that we have some tokens to spend, let's send some of them to another account.

Ok, let’s move on to writing our first transaction!

### Simple Transfers

Start by creating a new file `transfer.js` in the project directory and add the code below:

```
const {
    EnigmaUtils, SigningCosmWasmClient, Secp256k1Pen, pubkeyToAddress, encodeSecp256k1Pubkey
} = require("secretjs");

require('dotenv').config();

const main = async () => {
    
    const mnemonic = process.env.MNEMONIC;
    const httpUrl = process.env.SECRET_REST_URL;
    const signingPen = await Secp256k1Pen.fromMnemonic(mnemonic);
    const pubkey = encodeSecp256k1Pubkey(signingPen.pubkey);
    const accAddress = pubkeyToAddress(pubkey, 'secret');


    // 1. Initialise client

    // 2. Send tokens

    // 3. Query the tx result
}

main().then(resp => {
    console.log(resp);
}).catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
})

```
Unlike before, we didn't import CosmWasmClient to connect to Secret Network, 
instead we imported SigningCosmWasmClient, the bigger brother of CosmWasmClient with signing capability to interact with a CosmWasm blockchain. It provides convenience methods for executing contracts, sending tokens etc.

So first let's initialize that, in the transfer.js file under the comment `// 1. Initialize client` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
const txEncryptionSeed = EnigmaUtils.GenerateNewSeed();
const fees = {
    send: {
        amount: [{ amount: "80000", denom: "uscrt" }],
        gas: "80000",
    },
}
const client = new SigningCosmWasmClient(
    httpUrl,
    accAddress,
    (signBytes) => signingPen.sign(signBytes), 
    txEncryptionSeed, fees
);
```
We generated a seed and configured fee amounts before initializing the signing client.

### Send tokens
Under the comment `// 2. Send tokens` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
const rcpt = accAddress; // Set recipient to sender for testing, or generate another account as you did previously.

// Send 1 SCRT / 1000000 uscrt
const sent = await client.sendTokens(rcpt, [{amount: "1000000", denom: "uscrt"}]);
```

### Query transaction
Under the comment `// 3. Query transaction` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
const query = {id: sent.transactionHash};
const tx = await client.searchTx(query);
console.log('Transaction: ', tx);
```

Let's run the code:

```text
node transfer.js
```

If everything works \(you have enough tokens, recipient is valid, etc\) you should see an output similar to:

```javascript
Transaction:  [
  {
    height: 504795,
    hash: '8ED3C35EA83EF2A016AF900172563E0D7ECFA2AC00C616714EF3C68FC9AE9526',
    code: 0,
    rawLog: '[{"msg_index":0,"log":"","events":[{"type":"message","attributes":[{"key":"action","value":"send"},{"key":"sender","value":"secret1cdycaskx8g9gh9zpa5g8ah04ql0lzkrsxmcnfq"},{"key":"module","value":"bank"}]},{"type":"transfer","attributes":[{"key":"recipient","value":"secret1cdycaskx8g9gh9zpa5g8ah04ql0lzkrsxmcnfq"},{"key":"amount","value":"1234uscrt"}]}]}]',
    logs: [ [Object] ],
    tx: { type: 'cosmos-sdk/StdTx', value: [Object] },
    timestamp: '2020-12-12T06:43:19Z'
  }
]
```
----------------------------------------------------------------
Copy the transaction's `hash` from the output and replace `<TRANSACTION HASH>` in the link below, to see the transaction in Secret Explorer!
https://explorer.secrettestnet.io/transactions/<TRANSACTION HASH>
----------------------------------------------------------------

Great success! Our transaction went through and made it into the blockchain. Let's move onto the advanced transfers part of the tutorial.


### Advanced Transfers

Now that we know how to perform a simple money transfer we can dig a bit deeper and build a transaction from scratch. Such experience might be super useful for any developers interesting in building advanced applications. 

Start by creating a new file `send.js` in the project directory and add the code below:

```
const {
    CosmWasmClient, Secp256k1Pen, pubkeyToAddress, encodeSecp256k1Pubkey, makeSignBytes
} = require("secretjs");

require('dotenv').config();

const main = async () => {
    
    // As in previous tutorial, initialise client from ENV
    const mnemonic = process.env.MNEMONIC;
    const signingPen = await Secp256k1Pen.fromMnemonic(mnemonic);
    const pubkey = encodeSecp256k1Pubkey(signingPen.pubkey);
    const accAddress = pubkeyToAddress(pubkey, 'secret');
    const client = new CosmWasmClient(process.env.SECRET_REST_URL);
    const chainId = await client.getChainId();


    // Optionally, define a memo for the transaction
    const memo = 'My first secret transaction, sending uscrt';

    // 1. Define TX message

    // 2. Define fees

    // 3. Sign transaction
    
    // 4. Broadcast TX

    // 5. Query TX by hash/ID
}

main().then(resp => {
    console.log(resp);
}).catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
})

```
By now this should look familiar to you. Starting from the top you can see that we import secretjs, dotenv, and then create a new instance using `CosmWasmClient`. This establishes the connection to our Secret Network node. 
We then get the network and account information.



### Define TX message
In the `send.js` file under the comment `// 1. Define TX message` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
const sendMsg = {
    type: "cosmos-sdk/MsgSend",
    value: {
        from_address: accAddress,
        to_address: accAddress,
        amount: [
            {
                denom: "uscrt",
                amount: "1000000",
            },
        ],
    },
};
```

### Define fees
Under the comment `// 2. Define fees` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
const fee = {
    amount: [
        {
            amount: "50000",
            denom: "uscrt",
        },
    ],
    gas: "100000",
};
```

### Sign transaction
Under the comment `// 3. Sign transaction` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
const { accountNumber, sequence } = await client.getNonce(accAddress);
const signBytes = makeSignBytes([sendMsg], fee, chainId, memo, accountNumber, sequence);
const signature = await signingPen.sign(signBytes);
const signedTx = {
    msg: [sendMsg],
    fee: fee,
    memo: memo,
    signatures: [signature],
};
```

### Broadcast transaction
Under the comment `// 4. Broadcast transaction` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
const { logs, transactionHash } = await client.postTx(signedTx);
```

### Query transaction
Under the comment `// 5. Query transaction` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
const query = {id: transactionHash}
const tx = await client.searchTx(query)
console.log('Transaction: ', tx);
```

Let's run the code:

```text
node send.js
```

If everything works \(you have enough tokens, recipient is valid, etc\) you should see an output similar to:

```javascript
Transaction:  [
  {
    height: 400136,
    hash: '7C3C689EA4CEAD0C89BE039063909307C5C9048F76DF05E387E0368BD1C4435C',
    code: 0,
    rawLog: '[{"msg_index":0,"log":"","events":[{"type":"message","attributes":[{"key":"action","value":"send"},{"key":"sender","value":"secret1cdycaskx8g9gh9zpa5g8ah04ql0lzkrsxmcnfq"},{"key":"module","value":"bank"}]},{"type":"transfer","attributes":[{"key":"recipient","value":"secret1cdycaskx8g9gh9zpa5g8ah04ql0lzkrsxmcnfq"},{"key":"amount","value":"1000000uscrt"}]}]}]',
    logs: [ [Object] ],
    tx: { type: 'cosmos-sdk/StdTx', value: [Object] },
    timestamp: '2020-12-05T07:42:52Z'
  }
]
```
----------------------------------------------------------------
Copy the transaction's `hash` from the output and replace `<TRANSACTION HASH>` in the link below.
