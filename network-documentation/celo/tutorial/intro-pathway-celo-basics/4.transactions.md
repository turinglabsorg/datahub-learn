# 4. Submit your first transactions

## Introduction

It’s time to submit your first transactions. In this tutorial, we will connect to a Celo node hosted by DataHub and we will:

* Transfer our testnet tokens
* Exchange tokens

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that you completed the tutorials:

1. [Connect to Celo node with DataHub](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/celo/tutorial/1.connect)
2. [Create your first Celo account](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/celo/tutorial/2.account)
3. [Query the Celo Network](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/celo/tutorial/3.query)

We will be building on top of the NodeJS application you created in the previous tutorials.

## Transfer tokens

As you remember from previous tutorials, we funded our account on the Alfajores testnet with `5CELO` and `10cUSD`. Now let’s try to transfer those tokens to another test account.

Create file `transfers.js` and with the following snippet:

```javascript
const ContractKit = require('@celo/contractkit');
const Web3 = require('web3');

require('dotenv').config();

const main = async () => {
  // Create connection to DataHub Celo Network node
  const web3 = new Web3(process.env.REST_URL);
  const client = ContractKit.newKitFromWeb3(web3);

  // Initialize account from our private key
  const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);

  // We need to add private key to ContractKit in order to sign transactions
  client.addAccount(account.privateKey);

  // Specify recipient Address
  const recipientAddress = '0xD86518b29BB52a5DAC5991eACf09481CE4B0710d';

  // Specify an amount to send
  const amount = 100000;

  // Get contract wrappers
  const goldtoken = await client.contracts.getGoldToken();
  const stabletoken = await client.contracts.getStableToken();

  // Transfer CELO and cUSD from your account to anAddress
  // Specify cUSD as the feeCurrency when sending cUSD
  const celotx = await goldtoken.transfer(recipientAddress, amount).send({from: account.address})
      .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not transfer CELO: ${err}`) });
    const cUSDtx = await stabletoken.transfer(recipientAddress, amount).send({from: account.address, feeCurrency: stabletoken.address})
      .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not transfer cUSD: ${err}`) });

  // Wait for the transactions to be processed
  const celoReceipt = await celotx.waitReceipt();
  const cUSDReceipt = await cUSDtx.waitReceipt();

  // Print receipts
  console.log('CELO Transaction receipt:', celoReceipt);
  console.log('cUSD Transaction receipt:', cUSDReceipt);
};

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

Ok, let’s break it down. After we initialize the account with our private key, we need to add the account to ContractKit in order to be able to sign transactions. Then, we specify the recipient’s address and the amount we want to transfer. In this case, we will be transferring `100000 base CELO units` to the address `0xD86518b29BB52a5DAC5991eACf09481CE4B0710d`.

Here you can notice that we mentioned base Celo units. Since Javascript does not have floating-point numbers, it is common to convert integers to large numbers \(BigNumber\) before doing arithmetic. In the case of Celo, 1 CELO = 1e18 base units of CELO \(same for stable tokens like cUSD and cEUR\).

What is interesting about the code above is that we don’t call the transfer method directly on the ContractKit client. Instead, we first, get contract wrappers. Celo has a number of core Smart Contracts that are deployed to the network. In this example. we use GoldToken and StableToken contract wrappers, which both have the `transfer` function allowing us to build a transfer transaction. Here we build a transfer transaction to the same account for the same amount of CELO and cUSD. Don’t forget to call the `send` method, which takes a transfer transaction and broadcasts it to the Celo Alfajores network.

Since transactions may take some time to process, we need to wait for \_\*\*\_the response. In order to do that, we use the `waitReceipt` method:

```javascript
const celoReceipt = await celotx.waitReceipt()
const cUSDReceipt = await cUSDtx.waitReceipt()
```

Let’s run this script:

```bash
node transfers.js
```

If all went well, you should see a transaction receipt printed on the console. You can copy `transactionHash` and paste it in [Alfajores Explorer - BlockScout](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/txs).

## Exchange tokens

With ContractKit, you can always exchange your cUSD to CELO and the other way around. Let’s see how we can do that.

Create a file called `exchange.js` with the following snippet:

```javascript
const ContractKit = require('@celo/contractkit');
const Web3 = require('web3');

require('dotenv').config();

const main = async () => {
  // Create connection to DataHub Celo Network node
  const web3 = new Web3(process.env.REST_URL);
  const client = ContractKit.newKitFromWeb3(web3);

  // Initialize account from our private key
  const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);

  // We need to add private key to ContractKit in order to sign transactions
  client.addAccount(account.privateKey);

  // Get contract wrappers
  const stableToken = await client.contracts.getStableToken();
  const exchange = await client.contracts.getExchange();

  // Get cUSD balance
  const cUsdBalance = await stableToken.balanceOf(account.address)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not get cUSD balance: ${err}`) });

  // Approve a user to transfer StableToken on behalf of another user.
  const approveTx = await stableToken.approve(exchange.address, cUsdBalance).send({from: account.address})
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not send approve transaction: ${err}`) });
  const approveReceipt = await approveTx.waitReceipt();

  // Exchange cUSD for CELO
  // We will change 10 cUSD for approximately 2.6 * 10^18 base CELO units
  const goldAmount = await exchange.quoteUsdSell(cUsdBalance)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not get a quote: ${err}`) });
  const sellTx = await exchange.sellDollar(cUsdBalance, goldAmount).send({from: account.address})
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not send exchange transaction: ${err}`) });
  const sellReceipt = await sellTx.waitReceipt();

  // Print receipts
  console.log('Approve Transaction receipt:', approveReceipt);
  console.log('Sell Transaction receipt:', sellReceipt);
};

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

In this snippet, you can see that we will be using both the `StableToken` contract wrapper and the `Exchange` wrapper. This smart contract is responsible for exchanging tokens.

First we get the amount of cUSD that we own by calling `balanceOf`. Then we have to approve the exchange smart contract address to be able to exchange tokens on our behalf. Once we have this out of our way, we can call the `quoteUsdSell` method in order to get the amount of CELO we will receive for our cUSD. Finally, we call `sellDollar` to perform the exchange of tokens. This `exchange.js` file will debit our CELO balance with approximately 2.6\*1018 CELO base units and it will credit our cUSD balance with 10 cUSD.

OK, now let’s run the script:

```bash
node exchange.js
```

Congratulations! You’ve successfully exchanged cUSD to CELO.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we’ve learned how to submit transactions to the Celo blockchain using DataHub and ContractKit. In order to do that, we used many different smart contracts such as: StableToken, GoldToken and Exchange. For a more comprehensive list of available wrappers you can visit the [Celo documentation](https://docs.celo.org/v/master/developer-guide/contractkit/contracts-wrappers-registry).

The complete code for this tutorial can be found on [**Github**](https://github.com/figment-networks/tutorials/tree/main/celo/4_transactions).

### Next Steps

We now know how to query Celo network and how to submit transactions. So far we used only core Celo Smart Contracts but it’s time to deploy our own smart contract and interact with it.
