description: Creating simple counter dapp with celo dappkit
----

# Introduction to DappKit

## Introduction
Celo offers mobile friendly development environment which includes mainnet and testnet wallet, mobile SDK. 
In this tutorial we are going to make counter dapp with expo (react native). This dapp will be able to do following things:
- Get account, phone number from mobbile wallet
- Create transaction
- Sign transaction

## Prerequisite

You should have some basic knowledge of javascript, react and solidity. Also, have following requirements installed:
- Node.js
- Yarn Package Manager
- Truffle
- Expo (cli on your computer and expo client in your mobile)
- Celo mobile wallet (Alfajores)

As we are going to work with mobile app you should install expo mobile client and alfajores (celo testnet wallet for mobile devices). Make sure to fund your wallet with faucet.

## Setup

For setting up our development environment, create a new folder and run following command in that folder:

```sh 
truffle unbox critesjosh/celo-dappkit
```
This will download truffle box created by celo team. You can take a look at it [here](https://github.com/critesjosh/celo-dappkit).

Now, we need to install all the dependencies of our smart contract and mobile app.
```javascript
yarn // installs dependencies for truffle
cd client
yarn // isntalls dependencies for expo
```

## Smart Contract

Copy the following smart contract code into `HelloWorld.sol` file insideof `contracts` folder and then reaname the file to `Counter.sol`. We are not going through smart contract here but take a look at [solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/).

```javascript
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity >=0.5.0;
// Above statement specifies the compatible compiler versions
// Learn more about Solidity here: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.3/

// Declare a contract called HelloWorld
contract Counter {

  // Define a unsigned integer called name, initialize it to 'Celo'
  uint256 count = 0;

// Declare a function called getCount.
// The 'public' label means the function can be called internally, by transactions or other contracts.
// The 'view' label indicates that the function does not change the state of the contract.
// The function returns the value of count variable which is of type uint256
  function getCount() 
  public 
  view returns (uint256) {
    return count;
  }

// Declare a function called incrementCount
// The function increments value of count by 1.
// The 'external' label means the function can only be called from an external source
  function incrementCount() 
  external {
      count += 1;
  }

// Declare a function called decrementCount
// The function decrements value of count by 1.
// The 'external' label means the function can only be called from an external source
  function decrementCount() 
  external {
      require(count > 0, "Count is zero");
      count -= 1;
  }
}

```

### Deploy smart contract

For deployment, we need to create migration for `counter` smart contract. In `migrations` folder go to `2_deploy_contracts.js` and change every `HelloWorld` to `Counter`.

Run following command in terminal:
```javascript
yarn account
```
This will show you the account address from which you are gonna deploy the smart contract.
```javascript
xQc@RecycleBin MINGW64 ~/Documents/blockchain/celoDappCounter
$ yarn account
yarn run v1.22.4
$ node utils/createAccount.js
Account address: 0xbF0eC2F761F2C3303AE5f9695eE79d2EECdb2579
Done in 2.78s.
```
You need some fund in this account to deploy smart contract that you can get from [faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet).

We need to make one more change in `truffle-config.js`. Change `web3` that file to following:
```javascript
const web3 = new Web3('https://celo-alfajores--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/<YOUR_API_KEY>/')
```
Now, we can deploy the smart contract.

```javascript
truffle migrate --network alfajores
```
After samrt contract is done you should get something like this as output:
```javascript
xQc@RecycleBin MINGW64 ~/Documents/blockchain/celoDappCounter
$ truffle migrate --network alfajores

```

After this there should be 2 new files called `Counter.json` and `Migrations.json` inside `contracts` folder of `client`.

## Mobile Dapp

As we have completed our smart contract part of tutorial, we can move to creating mobile dapp.

Run
```javascript
cd client
```

We have to change some files before working on UI of our dapp. 

Delete `assets` folder in `client` and remove `icon` and `splash` field from `app.json`

Go to `root.js` and change `provider` constant
```javascript
export const provider = "https://celo-alfajores--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/<YOUR_API_KEY>/"
```

We will go through the react native code but first you should delete all code in `App.js` and paste the following:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import './global'
import { web3, kit } from './root'
import { StyleSheet, Text, Button, View } from 'react-native'
import {
  requestTxSig,
  waitForSignedTxs,
  requestAccountAddress,
  waitForAccountAuth,
  FeeCurrency
} from '@celo/dappkit'
import { toTxResult } from "@celo/connect"
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking'
import CounterContract from './contracts/Counter.json'

export default class App extends React.Component {

  // Set the defaults for the state
  state = {
    address: 'Not logged in',
    phoneNumber: 'Not logged in',
    cUSDBalance: 'Not logged in',
    CounterContract: {},
    count: ''
  }

  // This function is called when the page successfully renders
  componentDidMount = async () => {

    // Check the Celo network ID
    const networkId = await web3.eth.net.getId();

    // Get the deployed HelloWorld contract info for the appropriate network ID
    const deployedNetwork = CounterContract.networks[networkId];

    // Create a new contract instance with the HelloWorld contract info
    const instance = new web3.eth.Contract(
      CounterContract.abi,
      deployedNetwork && deployedNetwork.address
    );
    // Save the contract instance
    this.setState({ CounterContract: instance })
  }

  login = async () => {

    // A string you can pass to DAppKit, that you can use to listen to the response for that request
    const requestId = 'login'

    // A string that will be displayed to the user, indicating the DApp requesting access/signature
    const dappName = 'Counter'

    // The deeplink that the Celo Wallet will use to redirect the user back to the DApp with the appropriate payload.
    const callback = Linking.makeUrl('/my/path')

    // Ask the Celo Alfajores Wallet for user info
    requestAccountAddress({
      requestId,
      dappName,
      callback,
    })

    // Wait for the Celo Wallet response
    const dappkitResponse = await waitForAccountAuth(requestId)

    // Set the default account to the account returned from the wallet
    kit.defaultAccount = dappkitResponse.address

    // Get the stabel token contract
    const stableToken = await kit.contracts.getStableToken()

    // Get the user account balance (cUSD)
    const cUSDBalanceBig = await stableToken.balanceOf(kit.defaultAccount)

    // Convert from a big number to a string
    let cUSDBalance = cUSDBalanceBig.toString()

    // Update state
    this.setState({
      cUSDBalance,
      isLoadingBalance: false,
      address: dappkitResponse.address,
      phoneNumber: dappkitResponse.phoneNumber
    })
  }

  getCount = async () => {

    // Read the count stored in the Counter contract
    let _count = await this.state.CounterContract.methods.getCount().call()

    // Update state
    this.setState({ count: _count })
  }

  increment = async () => {
    const requestId = 'increment_count'
    const dappName = 'Counter'
    const callback = Linking.makeUrl('/my/path')

    // Create a transaction object to increment count
    const txObject = await this.state.CounterContract.methods.incrementCount()

    // Send a request to the Celo wallet to send an update transaction to the Counter contract
    requestTxSig(
      kit,
      [
        {
          from: this.state.address,
          to: this.state.CounterContract.options.address,
          tx: txObject,
          feeCurrency: FeeCurrency.cUSD
        }
      ],
      { requestId, dappName, callback }
    )

    // Get the response from the Celo wallet
    const dappkitResponse = await waitForSignedTxs(requestId)
    const tx = dappkitResponse.rawTxs[0]

    // Get the transaction result, once it has been included in the Celo blockchain
    let result = await toTxResult(kit.web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(tx)).waitReceipt()

    console.log(`Counter contract increment count transaction receipt: `, result)

    // Update count on UI
    await this.getCount();
  }

  decrement = async () => {
    const requestId = 'increment_count'
    const dappName = 'Counter'
    const callback = Linking.makeUrl('/my/path')

    // Create a transaction object to decrement the count
    const txObject = await this.state.CounterContract.methods.decrementCount()

    // Send a request to the Celo wallet to send an update transaction to the Counter contract
    requestTxSig(
      kit,
      [
        {
          from: this.state.address,
          to: this.state.CounterContract.options.address,
          tx: txObject,
          feeCurrency: FeeCurrency.cUSD
        }
      ],
      { requestId, dappName, callback }
    )

    // Get the response from the Celo wallet
    const dappkitResponse = await waitForSignedTxs(requestId)
    const tx = dappkitResponse.rawTxs[0]

    // Get the transaction result, once it has been included in the Celo blockchain
    let result = await toTxResult(kit.web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(tx)).waitReceipt()

    console.log(`Counter contract decrement count transaction receipt: `, result)

    // Update count on UI
    await this.getCount();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.title}>Login first</Text>
        <Button title="login()"
          onPress={() => this.login()} />
        <Text style={styles.title}>Account Info:</Text>
        <Text>Current Account Address:</Text>
        <Text>{this.state.address}</Text>
        <Text>Phone number: +91 ***** *****</Text>
        <Text>cUSD Balance: {this.state.cUSDBalance}</Text>

        <Text style={styles.title}>Get Count</Text>
        <Button title="Get Count"
          onPress={() => this.getCount()} />
        <Text style={styles.count}>{this.state.count}</Text>
        <View style={styles.buttonContainer}>
          <Button style={styles.button} title="Increment count"
            onPress={() => this.increment()} />
          <Button style={styles.button} title="Decrement count"
            onPress={() => this.decrement()} />
        </View>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#35d07f',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    marginVertical: 8,
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold'
  },
  buttonContainer: {
    flexDirection: 'row',
    paddingVertical: 30,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  count: {
    fontSize: 40
  }
});
```
We will go through code method by method.

Here we are using class component of react. These classes have states in which we can store the data.

In `state` variable of `App` class we are storing our data.

Then `componentDidMount` method is creating contract instance so that we can call methods of the smart contract. After creating the smart contract instance we are storing it in state variable `CounterContract`.

Now, we will be looking at methods given by dapp kit in `login` method of our `App` class.

Here we are setting 3 variables `requestId`, `dappName`, and `callback`.

- `requestId`: used to listen response of our request
- `dappName`: name will show up while getting permission from user 
- `callback`: deeplink that will use to redirect user back to dapp

While calling `requestAccountAddress`, we are passing above 3 parameters.

Now, user will be redirected to celo wallet to get account details which we will use to perform other actions in our dapp.

After getting account details from celo wallet, we will set those in our state variables.

As we are creating counter, we need to get the count. `getCount` method does that. It calls `getCount` method of our contract and stores count in state.

Now, we will increment the count with `incrementCount` method. For this we need to set same three variables `requestId`, `dappName`, and `callback`.

For incrementing count we will create transaction. But first we need to create transaction object `txObject` and then pass that to celo wallet using `requestTxSig`.

`requestTxSig` methods takes three arguments:
- kit: contract kit instance
- txParams: parameters required for transaction
- meta: object for dappkit for connecting with celo wallet

This method will create in transaction to increment value of count and you can check the transaction by transaction hash logged in console.

After this we are waiting for transaction to complete and then we are updating value of count.

`decrementCount` method is similar to `incrementCount` method but instead of calling the `incrementCount` function of smart conttract, we are calling `decrementCount` function.

Remaining method is `render` which takes care of UI. Also, we have `style` constant of end which is used for styling of our component.

Now, only thing remaining do to run our mobile application using expo client on our mobile deice.

Run 

```javascript
yarn start
```
This will open browser window like you see here

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/mIcw4LF.jpeg" width="500" title="Expo terminal">
</p>

There you can see QR code at bottom left scan it with QR code scanner from expo client in your mobile device.

It will open up our dapp. It should look like this

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/sBmSfbm.jpg" width="250" title="Main UI of Dapp">
</p>

Now we can go through process of incrementing the counter. First login by pressing login button. It will give us option to select our wallet of choice

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xnF3Mdw.jpg" width="250" title="Select your preferred wallet">
</p>

Select Alfajores wallet.

After selecting wallet it will redirect us to actual wallet and there it will ask for permission

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TCtRhZ3.jpeg" width="250" title="Account Auth">
</p>

Click on allow button to give information to our dapp. 

Now we got access to information it will redirect us to our dapp where account information is displayed now instead of `Not logged in` text

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ywor7bg.jpeg" width="250" title="Logged In">
</p>

We should now increment to count by pressing on increment count which will redirect us to wallet to sign the transaction

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/p7NdEga.jpeg" width="250" title="Sign Transaction">
</p>

Click on allow and after getting to our dapp screen we can see our count is increased by 1.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/alHJoiS.jpeg" width="250" title="count incremented">
</p>

And just like that we have created our first ever mobile app.

## Wrapping Wp

In this tutorial we have covered some part of dapp kit, how it connects with celo mobile wallet, how we can connect our dapp with the mobile wallet and how to do some basic things like getting account address, balance of account, phone number connected to celo mobile wallet, and signing transaction, etc.
