Celo’s aim is to empower anyone with a smartphone anywhere in the world to have access to financial services, send money to phone numbers, and pay merchants -- on a decentralized platform that is operated by a community of users.   
  
To achieve this, Celo offers a complete stack of new blockchain software, core libraries that run on that blockchain, and end-user applications including a Wallet app that communicates with that logic. Learn what makes it unique and build your first project.
