#  Introduction 
Full nodes are a major part of the celo blockchain. A full node is a program that will help to write, and validate new changes in the network. Multiple full nodes work together, validating the blockchain in a decentralized way. This Virtual Machines job will be to create a full node, and run a light client monitoring the network.

#   Prerequisites 
* Have a basic understanding of Virtual Machines(VM), and the Linux terminal.

* Install the Valora app on iOS or Android: https://valoraapp.com/

* Download the most recent Debian 10.x 64-bit ISO: https://www.debian.org/ 

* Download VirtualBox, the Oracle VM host: https://www.virtualbox.org/
 
* Download Signal for iOS or Android: https://www.signal.org/

#   Creating the VM
              
* Click on "Create New" in VirtualBox
* Select a dynamically allocated virtual hard disk
* Start the Virtual Machine
* Create a new user 
* Select "Use entire disk", then write the changes to disk
* Select the checkboxes: Debian desktop environment, SSH server, Standard system utilities 
* Install the Grub bootloader onto the Virtual HARDDISK

The installation of Debian is complete and the VM is now ready.
 
##   Gain sudo on the VM
On Linux, the command `sudo` stands for "substitute user do". Once a user account is added to the `sudo` group, it will be able to act with administrator or "root" privileges on the VM. 
   
The following commands are entered into the VM terminal:
 
`su -`  
  
- Enter the root password of the VM.
 
`usermod -aG sudo $YOURUSERNAME` 
 
- $YOURUSERNAME = currently logged in users username. 
     
- Restart the VM
    
`id`
 
- Find (sudo) in the group list:

##   Install dependencies   
Curl will be used for inserting GitHub scripts into the terminal.
   
Docker is a service that will be running the light client. 
   
Vim is a tool used for editing files within the terminal. [Click here](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/vim-101-beginners-guide-vim/) to read a beginners guide to Vim.
   
`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
         
`sudo apt install docker.io`
    
`sudo apt install curl`
    
`sudo apt install vim`
  
##  Enable bidirectional copy/paste, and improve resolution 
Run an external program called VBoxLinuxAdditions, which enables copy/paste between the VM and the host machine.
   
- Cursor over devices in the top left corner, and select: Insert Guest Additions CD Image 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80616939/118760448-0ebadb80-b830-11eb-88fa-51e672a41d83.png)
    
`cd /media/cdrom`

`ls`
  
`sudo sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run`
    
- Restart the VM
    
- Select Bidirectional copy/paste under devices in shared clipboard

Linux headers provide many vital functions without installing unnecessary files. While VBoxLinuxAdditions provides the dynamic screen resolution.

``` sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r` ```

- Restart the VM

- Select adjust window size under view. 

##   Create the environment, join Docker, and install the Celo client  
Insert this file to add functionality for node.js, and install nvm. Source in files after adding them. 
   
`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash`
  
`source ~/.bashrc` 
  
Install/use node.js version 10, then install the celo application onto this client.  
   
`nvm install 10`
  
`nvm use 10` 
  
`npm install -g @celo/celocli` 
  
Next join into the Docker group.
  
`sudo usermod -aG docker $YOURUSERNAME `
  
- Restart VM
  
`id`
  
- Check for (docker)   
   
Docker is required for running the light client. 
   
The interpreter directive, "#!" is called a "shebang". The path, "/bin/bash" sets the terminal to interpret in bash.  
   
`#!/bin/bash`
  
`set -x`
  
The following argument makes sure that the "celo.env" file will be loaded into the terminal. 
 
 ```
  if test -f celo.env; then 
           . celo.env
     fi
    +test -f celo.env   
 ```
- Close this terminal 
    
##  Use Curl to create 2 new files
To learn about ".env" files check out this [guide]( https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/extra-guides/dotenv-and-.env).
   
Curl uses the raw github code, and instantly creates the new files.
   
- This ".env" file is for storing and accessing sensitive environment variables. It will hold variables for the public keys. 
 
``` 
curl -o celo.env https://gist.githubusercontent.com/alchemydc/ce712f6f3caa7ec79f15f930ed5904ed/raw/385c65b1d3f760854258bfd6dd8cbd135710b78f/celo.env 

source celo.env
```
here are the contents of this file, if you'd like to create "celo.env" your self: 
```   
export CELO_IMAGE=us.gcr.io/celo-org/geth:mainnet
export CELO_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS="YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS"
```
- The second file runs the light client, and contains information about the node. This file requires Docker.

``` 
curl -o start_celo.sh https://gist.githubusercontent.com/alchemydc/e28945f5059acd70969b39a50fd0f80a/raw/0d15cceb89ea86ca46df94441c06ecd88a4e6635/start_celo.sh 
  
source start_celo.sh
```

##  Move these files into a new directory; celo-data-dir
- The directory will be called "celo-data-dir".
   
- "mkdir" makes a new directory. 
   
- "cd" choose the directory.
   
- "mv" moves a file into the directory. 

```    
mkdir celo-data-dir && cd celo-data-dir
  
mv ../celo.env . 
mv ../start_celo.sh .
    
source celo.env && source start_celo.sh
```

- Source in files after making changes
## Create the Node, while in the celo-data-dir 
  
`docker run -v $PWD:/root/.celo --rm -it $CELO_IMAGE account new`
  
- Copy the public address key that is provided with your new node account:

`vim celo.env`
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80616939/118758843-044b1280-b82d-11eb-88df-e83e5fb813f4.png)
 
- In vim press "i" for insert mode.
  
- Delete YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS with Backspace.
    
- Paste in the address with "shift insert".  
    
- Exit vim by pressing ":", then typing "wq" "enter". 

`source celo.env`
 
 ## Running the light client
 
`chmod u+x ./start_celo.sh`, Gives the user permision to start the light client. 

`./start_celo.sh`, Starts the light client.
   
`cat ./start_celo.sh`, Displays node information. 
   
`docker stop geth`, Stops the light client. 
   
- Use 2 terminal tabs. One for starting the light client, and the second for all other commands.    
   
` ./start_celo.sh` 
    
`celocli node:synced`
    
- If true the node is connected.   
    
`celocli account:balance NODE_ADDRESS`
    
`docker stop geth`
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80616939/118338503-8eb11080-b4d3-11eb-99a3-11417cf79b32.png)

## Sending Celo to and from the node
   
- Send both CUSD, and CELO native token to your node address. 
   
- Have 2 terminal windows open. One is for running the light client, and the other for entering commands.
   
- Make sure both terminals are in the celo-data-dir. 

`cat ./start_celo.sh`
 
`docker exec -it geth geth attach`
    
`exit`
    
`celocli account:unlock $PUBLIC_ADDRESS`
    
- Enter password 
    
`source celo.env`
  
`celocli transfer:dollars --from $NODE_ADDRESS --to $PHONE_ADDRESS --value=1e16`
   
Understanding this unit of measurement: 1e16 = 0.01CUSD, 1e15 = 0.1CUSD, 1e14 = 1.0CUSD.

## Conclusion
  The fullnode and light client should now be operational. Keep in mind this tutorial is not the only way to set up a full node. This node is now under your control so remember the keys and passwords to avoid losing any money. Please experiment with this setup and personalize it. The start_celo.sh and celo.env files are both easily customizable.
