# ✒ Contribute and Earn

## \*\*\*\*🤝 **What is Share to Earn and why should I contribute?**

Share to Earn is a program that supports people who create content for the Web 3 Knowledge Base. Through the program, community authors receive a personal payout in tokens and get to showcase their knowledge and skills to the community. The work of these community authors helps grow Figment Learn's library of Web 3 tutorials and benefits the entire ecosystem.

## 💸 What is the payout structure?

Authors are paid in the tokens of the protocol they write about, which allows us to align their incentives with the growth of the network's userbase. New tutorials are paid between $300 and $500 in token equivalent, while complex production-focused updates for existing tutorials are typically paid $100 in token equivalent. All payouts are at editorial discretion.

* **Guides and documentation** \(eg. "Polkadot Blockchain Terms", "Solana Basic to Advanced Complete Guide"\): $100/$200
* **Short tutorials** \(eg. “How to write & deploy a smart contract”\): $200/$300
* **Larger, original tutorials** \(eg. full-stack dApp with front-end\): $300/$500
* **Pathway** \(eg. A combination of 4-5 interconnected tutorials\): Get in touch with us!

We reserve the right to pay more for exceptional contributions.

## 🧩 What is the publication process?

1. **Apply:** Apply to the program with your topic idea and we will get in touch to review your qualifications. We publish only original, first-run content that brings value to the community  
2. **Collaborate:** If you're accepted, you'll work with the editorial team to refine your topic and outline for your tutorial 
3. **Write:** Once your topic is approved, it's time to write  
4. **Revise:** Submit your first draft and collaborate one-on-one with one of our editors to revise your work  
5. **Publish:** After revisions, your editor will send your payment, publish your article, and ask what you want to write about next. Figment will also promote your article across all of our social networks and you will be identified as the author in the knowledge base. 

## **📝 What is the contribution review process?**

1. First, make sure you have a Github account. Visit [Github.com](http://Github.com) to create a new account if you don't have one yet, it's free.
2. Clone the Datahub Learn documentation [repository](https://github.com/figment-networks/datahub-learn): It's important that you have the most recent version of documentation before you start your contribution. If you have already cloned it, make sure to pull down the latest changes.
3. Create a new git branch in your local repository, you can name it however you want, though we prefer if you pick a name relevant to your contribution. \(Example: near-nft-tutorial\).
4. Create a new file\(s\) under the tutorials section of the network documentation you're contributing to. Example: _**network-documentation/near/tutorials/my-new-tutorial.md**_
5. **⚠ Most Importantly -** Once you have completed the documentation make sure you have added a new entry in the _**SUMMARY.md**_ file.

Finally, when you're ready to submit your contribution for review, head over to the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/figment-networks/datahub-learn/pulls) section and create a new pull request from your branch. Our team will start the review process and suggest edits in the same pull request.

Once your pull request is approved and merged by our team, it will be automatically published on Learn!

To get your new tutorial reviewed and published, please complete this form - [**bit.ly/learntutorial**](http://bit.ly/learntutorial)

Once our team gets to it, they will review the content and open a discussion with you on discord or email. At the end of this process, they will either include your changes into the Figment Learn or request additional changes. For the final submission of your tutorial you have to make a PR to our GitHub [**HERE**](https://github.com/figment-networks/datahub-learn)
